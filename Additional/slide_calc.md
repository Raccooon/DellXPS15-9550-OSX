# How to calculate the slide parameter for OsxAptioFix2Drv
If you cannot boot because of an error like "couldn't allocate runtime area" with OSXAptioFIX2 then your memory is too fragmented. 
You need to manually "slide" the pointer of the OSXAptioFix2 to a free map in your memory.  
Because this memory map is unique to each system configuration you have to use a different slide command on most computers.    

## Step 1: Get Memory Map
![MEMMAP](BIOS/pictures/memmap.jpg "Memory Map")  
Boot into the UEFI Shell from Clover and enter the command `memmap`. You'll get an output like from the image above

## Step 2: Use hexadecimal calculator
![Calc](BIOS/pictures/calc.png "Calc")  
use a hexadecimal calculator (like calc from mac in programmers mode on 16)

## Step 3: Add the number of pages till first suitable block
you need a decent amount of pages to boot. Look in your memmap for the first Available block with enough pages.
As show in the image, the first enough page is 12E98000.
Each integer in slide will move the pointer 200000. It begins at 100000. So the calculation would be:  
(TARGET - 100000) / 200000. 
Use hex cal the result is 96.

## Step 4: Switch to Base 10 
convert the number to Base10 (normal number). You can do this with the mac os calc by pressing the button with the 10 on it.

We got the hex result is 96, so dec result is 150.
This is your slide parameter. Enter it in your boot command (for example slide=160) and everything should work. If it doesn't then maybe your block doesn't have enough free pages and you have to select a bigger one.
You can find the boot argument just at the clover boot, serval icon behind your os x, an icon named Options
